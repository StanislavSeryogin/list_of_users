# Testing app LIST_OF_USERS
### The program receives user data from a remote API and displays them on the main page in the form of cards. When a user clicks on a card, it takes them to a page with detailed information about that user.

#
### In this app I used packages:
####  - state manager: *GetX*;
####  - HTTP requests: *http*;
####  - plugin for launching a URL: *url_launcher*;
####  - local storage packages: *shared_preferences*;
